Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Project Objective

The goal of this project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival.Using statistical summaries and visualizations, this study uncovers trends, patterns, and relationships in the data that will help guide future feature engineering and model development.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python
Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – static data visualizations
Plotly – interactive visualizations

 Steps Performed in EDA
1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection

Imported dataset and libraries.
Viewed dataset shape, data types, and missing values.
Identified important variables for further analysis.

Understanding dataset structure ensured a clear roadmap for data cleaning and analysis.
It also helped locate critical missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).

2. Summary Statistics

Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, quartiles) for both numerical and categorical features.
Provided insights into:
Central tendencies
Variability
Presence of outliers
Distribution of key features
These summaries formed the baseline understanding for deeper visual analysis.

3. Visualizing Distributions (Histograms & KDE Plots)

Created histograms for numeric features like Age and Fare.
Helped identify skewed distributions (e.g., Fare), and understand demographic patterns like:
Age distribution of passengers
Fare ranges and purchasing behavior

4. Outlier Detection (Boxplots)
Plotted boxplots for numerical variables to visually detect extreme values.
Showed heavy-tailed Fare distribution and highlighted extreme values that could affect model performance.
Guided decisions for future outlier removal or transformation.

5. Correlation Analysis & Pairplots
A correlation heatmap
Pairplots to visualize feature interactions
Revealed:
Strong negative correlation between Pclass and Survived
Positive relationship between Fare and Survived
Almost no correlation between SibSp/Parch and Survival individually
This helped identify influential survival predictors.

6. Pattern & Trend Discovery

Analyzed survival rates by:
Sex
Passenger Class (Pclass)
Age Groups

Females had significantly higher survival rates
1st class passengers survived more
Children (especially <10 years) showed better survival likelihood
Higher fare often associated with survival


These insights form the backbone for any predictive modeling on Titanic data.
They highlight which features should be prioritized during feature engineering.

Overall Impact of the EDA

The EDA process provided a strong understanding of:
The dataset’s distribution
Key survival-driving features
Patterns that can guide feature engineering
Relationships that matter most for predictive modeling
This clarity ensures that future ML models built on this dataset will be more accurate, interpretable, and reliable.

Conclusion
This EDA uncovers the crucial patterns behind survival on the Titanic.
By combining statistical analysis and visualization, it lays the foundation for effective predictive modeling and deeper insight into historical human behavior
